# Module 11 Challenge: Note Taker
  ![License:MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg) 

  ## Description
  
  We were tasked with completing the back-end portion of this project using Express: html and api routes were made to navigate through the pages and to give functionality to the Note Maker app.
  
  This project allows you to create notes, which are saved in a side-bar that can be viewed later. Notes can also be viewed when clicked on as well as deleted.
  
  This exercise was my first delve into building routes in Express and giving an app functionality using an Express server.
